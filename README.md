# python
Python3 scripts I've written for a homelab or work environement.
See individual repo's README files for more details.
1. [Icinga1 -> Icinga2 Configuration Conversion Script](https://github.com/greggoryrussell/python/blob/main/icinga1-to-icinga2.py) Helped me upgrade a deprecated monitoring server.
2. [Dog Logs](https://github.com/greggoryrussell/doglogs) A script that helps the user tracks their dog's business and writes it into a CSV file.
